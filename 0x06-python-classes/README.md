A high-level language is a programming language designed to simplify computer programming. High-level source code contains easy-to-read syntax that is later converted into a low-level language, which can be recognized and run by a specific CPU. Most common programming languages are considered high-level languages.

Examples of high-level programming languages in active use today include Python, Visual Basic, Delphi, Perl, PHP, ECMAScript, Ruby, C#, Java and many others. The terms high-level and low-level are inherently relative.
